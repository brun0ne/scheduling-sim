### Process scheduling algorithms:
- FCFS (first come first serve)
- SJF (shortest job first)
- SRTF (shortest remaining time first)
- RR (round robin)

### Disk scheduling algorithms:
- FCFS (first come first serve)
- SSTF (shortest seek time first)
- SCAN
- C-SCAN
- EDF (earliest deadline first) - *real time*
- FD-SCAN (feasible deadline SCAN) - *real time*
